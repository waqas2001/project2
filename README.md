React Project 2

Tech Marketplace App

Create a marketplace for buying and selling tech gadgets, such as smartphones, laptops, cameras, and other electronic devices. 

Key Features:
Product Listings: Users can list their tech gadgets for sale with details like device type, brand, colors, specifications, condition, price, and time on the market.

Product Browsing: Display a list of tech products that are available on the marketplace with details like type, brand, condition, and price. Users should be able to filter based on their preferences.

Product Detail Page: Clicking on a product shows more detailed information, with the option to add an item to cart. Items that are in the user's cart should not exist in the marketplace anymore (due to lack of a secure purchase system)

Device Auction: Users can place a bid for the device and can compete with other users on the price. A device will be sold at it's highest bidding price, unless it is added to a cart at the listed price.   


Responsibilities:
Decide as a team on how the final app will look. It is important to have a unified theme and overall design for all parts of the app. 
Work as a team to identify how each of the features will be interacting with one another. Although each team member will be taking ownership of one key feature, all parts of the app must work seamlessly together.
As a team, decide on the component hierarchy for each feature. You will need to justify your choices, explaining how your chosen structure enhances the application's functionality and user experience.
As a team, decide on what kind of data management your app will need, and set up the Mock API for the app. Since some features require more data than others, ensure to approach the dataset development as a team effort. Optionally, you may explore free APIs to populate your app with data (but will still need to create a Mock API for storing app-specific information). 
Implement your application using React components. Focus on creating reusable components and managing state and props efficiently.
Start with a simple design and basic functionality. Once the foundational aspects of your app are working well, progressively add more complexity and advanced features. Pay attention to the user interface and experience, ensuring that the design is intuitive and user-friendly.

Expectations:
All code that is submitted is your own. Teammates are encouraged support one another's learning, but do not code on someone else's behalf.
By the end of the project, your team should have a working application in your chosen domain. 
Be prepared to explain the reasoning behind your component hierarchy and the structure of your application.
Use Git for version control throughout the project. Your code should be well-documented and pushed regularly to a shared GitHub repository.
Each team will present their application, showcasing the features and explaining the component architecture, state management, and any challenges encountered.

Notes:

The application may seem daunting at first, with many moving parts! It's okay. Make use of Wireframing and User Stories to break down each feature into small achievable tasks. 
Imagine you are building a real-life application! What would your target user want to be able to do in the application? (Feel free to ask friends and family for ideas! Market research is an important step in app development)
The number of Key Features required for the web app depends on the number of team members in your group (3 or 4). 
Since we haven't covered secure user login and user management in detail yet, the applications will be using minimal user management. As you gain further skills, you will be able to update your webpage to have user-specific accounts!
Your team must utilize GitHub features for collaboration throughout the project.
Remember, a simple app that works is much more valuable than a fancy-looking app with bugs! Start simple and weave in one small addition at a time, ensuring that it works before moving on to another. 
Most importantly: have fun!
